![insert gameplay footage](tech_demo.gif)
  
An arcade flying game I'm doing the art and progamming for in my spare time. Hope that by final release you have half as much fun playing it as I did making it <3
  
## Alpha Demo (3/16/23)
~Whew it's been a minute, but the alpha demo is now out with the following improvements:  
* `[New Mechanic]`: Stealing enemy planes. Fly by a weakened enemy plane and 'RMB' to take it over.
* `[New Mechanic]`: Rolling. Avoid obstacles and enemy fire by briefly flying over them. Rolling locks your direction in place
* `[New Weapon]`: Flamethrower ðŸ”¥
* 6 plane types with their own stats and armaments
* New airship enemies
* In-game tutorial
* Improved backgrounds
  
### Controls
Your plane turns and moves towards your mouse.  
* 'LMB' to shoot in the direction you're facing.
* 'RMB' to bring out your lasso. Approach a weakened plane from the correct angle to steal it.
* 'X' to boost. Your ability to turn drops sharply.
* 'Z' to brake. Braking after boosting allows you to make sharp turns.
* 'C' to roll. Dodge obstacles and enemy fire.
* 'F' to toggle fullscreen/windowed.
  
### Running the Demo
`Tested only on Windows` 
1. Download the `Foray_Installer.exe` file
2. If Windows blocked the .exe, hit "More Info" and it'll let you run the installer
3. Once installation is done, it'll create a game folder in the directory you specified. Navigate to the folder and launch `Foray.exe` to start the game
  
__To uninstall__, simply delete the `Foray` game folder from the path you specified when you installed the game. By default it's in C:\Users\\[username]\Foray. You can also run `Add or Remove Programs` and select `Foray` from the list of programs, then hit uninstall.
  
### Known Bugs
* **This game won't run on a 4k monitor.** Sorry about that, I'll get it fixed as soon as I can.
* When the game resets itself after you die in *windowed mode*, the camera will be misaligned. Pressing 'F' to enable fullscreen should fix this.
* When shooting down a flamethrower enemy, the flame may stay in place. I'm working on a fix, thanks for being patient!

### Roadmap
* 3/31/2023: solid obstacles; 4k monitor bug fix
* 4/30/2023: 1st full level completed; other bugs fixed
