# Foray
An arcade flying game I'm doing the art and progamming for in my spare time. Hope that by final release you have half as much fun playing it as I did making it <3
  
## Technical Demo (7/26/18)
This technical demo showcases how it feels to pilot your biplane. It also features crude enemy AIs that navigate the world by following traditional steering behaviors.
  
This demo also showcases a preliminary particle system for bullet fx, and shaders which I use to swap color palettes.
  
### Controls
Your plane turns and moves towards your mouse.  
* 'LMB' to shoot in the direction you're facing.
* 'Z' to brake. Braking allows you to make sharp turns. 
* 'X' to boost. Your ability to turn drops sharply.
  
### Running the Demo
`Tested only on Windows` Foray.exe contains the installer. Run it and follow the installation wizard.
  
__To uninstall__, simply delete the `Foray` game folder from the path you specified when you installed the game. By default it's in C:\Users\\[username]\Foray. You can also run `Add or Remove Programs` and select `Foray` from the list of programs, then hit uninstall.
  
### Roadmap
* Collisions. So you may rain fire upon your enemies!
* Mechanics for weakening and commandeering enemy planes. Upgrade your air ride by just stealing your enemies'!
* More juicy particle fx
* Multiple weapon types
* Refined tile assets and better parallax
