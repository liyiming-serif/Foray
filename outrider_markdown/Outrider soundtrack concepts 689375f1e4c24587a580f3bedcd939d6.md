# Outrider soundtrack concepts

*Welcome to the world of Outrider.* Each soundtrack I‚Äôd like to have is tied to a level (+menu) so I thought I‚Äôd write this concept doc like a game manual.

# Main theme

![*The Nasrid of Alma: a ring of islands floating atop a gas giant (wip)*](Outrider%20soundtrack%20concepts%20689375f1e4c24587a580f3bedcd939d6/overworld.png)

*The Nasrid of Alma: a ring of islands floating atop a gas giant (wip)*

*The Espada Junta, riled with ideological fervor over their General√≠simo, Castillo I, have begun their lightning campaign against the separated Alghurab rulers. In their crosshairs stands the Nasrid of Alma, and in their path stands you.*

*The game opens with a shot of the invasion force commencing a bombing run and defenders flying out to meet them. The menu theme plays through this sequence, the following title screen, and the level select screen.*

I‚Äôd like this to be a short jingle that‚Äôs intense but also fuels you with determination to hype the player up. Example: Castlevania II - Silence of Daybreak

I forgot if we had any problems with using nylon stringed guitar sounds or flamenco?

# Level soundtracks

For each of the level themes I was wondering if I could have 3 different mixes of increasing intensity {scouring‚Üíengaging enemy‚Üíboss}? Each one is the same track just adding more voices on.

Each level should take ~30min to complete, ~10min if the player blitzes through it. About the same time as Plants vs Zombies 1 if you need a reference for track length.

## Khalil Station

![Khalil Station - connects to the rest of Alma. Defend the railways against the Junta‚Äôs bombardment](Outrider%20soundtrack%20concepts%20689375f1e4c24587a580f3bedcd939d6/Untitled.png)

Khalil Station - connects to the rest of Alma. Defend the railways against the Junta‚Äôs bombardment

*Alma‚Äôs central station is under siege from Junta airships. Her garrison replies with anti-air rifles and armored cars.*

I really like the sample you sent a while back. The piano would pair well with some rhythms that invoke trains. Can‚Äôt wait to hear where you take this track.

Other sound ideas: Celeste - Scattered and Lost

## Peregrine Park

![Peregrine Park - open farmland where barnstormers testflight](Outrider%20soundtrack%20concepts%20689375f1e4c24587a580f3bedcd939d6/Untitled%201.png)

Peregrine Park - open farmland where barnstormers testflight

*Barnstormers from around the planet rushed to enlist in the defense effort, including a local star who‚Äôs all too eager to test their skills against Junta guns.*

Soundtrack: Airy and melancholy, like Vah Medoh‚Äôs theme after the first terminal. I‚Äôm a fan of the strings and how the track builds after each terminal:

Or intense classical music:

## Dinari Square

![Dinari Square - a melting pot of Alghurabi and Romi peoples, lifting supply airships to aid the resistance](Outrider%20soundtrack%20concepts%20689375f1e4c24587a580f3bedcd939d6/mockup3.png)

Dinari Square - a melting pot of Alghurabi and Romi peoples, lifting supply airships to aid the resistance

*Romis are a nomadic minority who live among and travel between Alghurabi and Espadish cities. Caravans of Romi families settled in Alma creating an enclave nicknamed ‚ÄúDinari Square‚Äù.*

*Knowing the open persecution they‚Äôd face under Junta occupation, Romi families banded together to airlift supplies to beleaguered Alghurabi defenders. Fend off Espadish pilots dispatched to crush them.*

Soundtrack ideas: Bells and funky spy music! This is a covert operation

[This was the best example I could find of bells in an upbeat song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGR4Lj8cpYs&t=205s)

If it gets too frustrating you can drop the bell part:

## Astrohall

![Astrohall - a mosque university surrounding an ancient observatory. Houses the Badajoz Cannon](Outrider%20soundtrack%20concepts%20689375f1e4c24587a580f3bedcd939d6/mockup5.png)

Astrohall - a mosque university surrounding an ancient observatory. Houses the Badajoz Cannon

*Any ideas that run counterculture to the Junta‚Äôs are enthusiastically incinerated by the Cardinals. The observatory cannons‚Äîused to shoot down and study approaching asteroids‚Äîare formidable but need time adjust to the enemy‚Äôs altitude.*

For sound, all my notes say is ‚ÄúAvatar chanting to bossa nova‚Äù. I give you full creative control over non-lyrical chanting or drums.

Idea 1: Drum and bass. 90s Capcom music

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVGLUZcgWI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVGLUZcgWI)

Idea 2: Castanets count as percussion

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuHHUDnFSO0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuHHUDnFSO0)

Idea 3: Love these drums from Cowboy Bebop

## Straits of G√°llego

![Straits of G√°llego - electrical storms power the district‚Äôs radio towers and a secret experimental weapon](Outrider%20soundtrack%20concepts%20689375f1e4c24587a580f3bedcd939d6/mockup4.png)

Straits of G√°llego - electrical storms power the district‚Äôs radio towers and a secret experimental weapon

*The atmosphere in this district is unusually thin, allowing radio stations to broadcast to the rest of the continent. Prevent the Junta‚Äôs shock force from cutting off all communications*

Do you do metal? I was thinking this level‚Äôs theme would incorporate electric instruments. Like start with the bass when the player‚Äôs scouring, and ramp up to the full mix

[Hades has a separate bass-only mix that plays when you‚Äôre out of combat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqFaCDvHxU4)

The instrumentals from the ‚ÄúHeavy Metal Queen‚Äù episode

Metal‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs thing, so I‚Äôm open to other ideas. Maybe surf rock?

## Alma

![Alma - reference art for the capitol district, where the final offensive takes place](Outrider%20soundtrack%20concepts%20689375f1e4c24587a580f3bedcd939d6/Untitled%202.png)

Alma - reference art for the capitol district, where the final offensive takes place

*Castle Alma, the city‚Äôs last bastion.* The big battle final level to test all the player‚Äôs skills.

Haven‚Äôt completely thought up this area yet. This is going to be a longer level so the music should distinct enough sections so the player won‚Äôt get bored.

Idea 1: Reprise of a track you‚Äôre most proud of making

Idea 2: I‚Äôm not sure how but this track has that ‚Äútense stillness before the final fight‚Äù energy. I‚Äôd like this atmosphere with Spanish or Near Eastern instruments

### Sub-district: Marcia

![Marcia - a field hospital established to treat the wounded](Outrider%20soundtrack%20concepts%20689375f1e4c24587a580f3bedcd939d6/mockup3%201.png)

Marcia - a field hospital established to treat the wounded

A cut level I‚Äôm repurposing as a sub-area within Alma. It doesn‚Äôt need it‚Äôs own theme, but it‚Äôs something to swing at if you‚Äôre left with nothing to do üôÇ

# Specs and deadline

I‚Äôve never written a soundtrack concept doc before. Please let me know what specs you‚Äôd like me to elaborate on.

What kind of music are you most comfortable making? I threw a bunch of different genres at you in this doc but we can coalesce around something you‚Äôre more familiar with.

Tentative deadline: February, next year? Vacation time is approaching and we‚Äôll probably go through a lot of drafts in between and afterwards so it‚Äôs not a hard deadline.

‚≠ê Thanks again for all your help man! I really appreciate it ‚≠ê
